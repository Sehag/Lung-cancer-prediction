# Lung-cancer-prediction  
Lung cancer has been the largest cause of cancer deaths. Early detection of lung cancer can increase the chance of survival among people. The effectiveness of the cancer prediction system helps people to know their cancer risk with a low cost and it also helps people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status. Our initial solution approach is to determine the prediction or detection of lung cancer by subjecting to various machine learning models like KNN, SVM, Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest classifier. This prediction model helps us to find symptoms which lead to lung cancer and predict the cancer. We hope to take some of the statistical tools proposed by the authors in the papers and look to implement the best model possible.
